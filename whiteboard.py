# The championship round of matches is over. Hooray!

# We have diligently recorded all of the results of the matches in an array of tuples. The first
# value in the tuple represents that teams score, the second value in the tuple represents their oponents.
# We need you to build a function to help us determine if that team has won or not. Return True if
# the # of matches that they won is more than they have lost, False otherwise.


# Examples
# Input = [(5,3), (10,7), (2,8), (3,3), (4,1)]
# Output = True 
# Explanation = The team won their 1st, 2nd and last match (for a total of 3 wins) and only lost the 3rd.


# Input = [(1,3), (5,7), (8,4)]
# Output = False
# Explanation = The team lost their first two matches and only won their 3rd and final match.
